Repo for [advent of code](adventofcode.com) solutions.

The AdventUtils code, along with everything in the norvig dir, was written by [norvig](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes/tree/main/ipynb). I've been solving each problem my way, checking how he did it, then going back and (often drastically) improving my solution.
